        "question": "In psychological testing, more specifically memory science, it has been posited that t1 and t2 measurements as a stand-alone are invalid rather experiments should involve two organisms. The control group would not be exposed to t1, then measure the results of the two. What are the implications of such a change in procedure when experimenting with learning?",
        "answer": "first, it forces one to confront seriously the question of what is a good comparison treatment at t1 involving not receiving the experience. Secondly, it opens up the class of differences that are taken as evidence at t2 to include behaviors and other features that are not measured at t1. Thirdly, it implies that acquisition curves are useless in the study of learning. Data taken during the t1 acquisition period almost invariably come from animals receiving different treatments dictated by the independent variables of interest. That means that they are not taken under comparable conditions for the different groups. As a result, one cannot be sure any differences reflect differences in learning as distinct from differences in local conditions in which the data are taken. A common t2 test naturally addresses that problem",
