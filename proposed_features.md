# Planned changes:

## Core Functionality

### Picture and GUI module

- CLI is useful, but doesn't allow for display of images for problems. If this is to be used for science and mathematics, support for latex and picture display needs to be added in:
- I would say this is front end

### Backup storage module

- In case data might get overwritten, a regular backup should be made. A function that can be called from within the program should help make this easy for the user to backup their files
- A second function can be called that pulls the files from backups/ and overwrites the files in the main directory.

## Check function to see which concepts have questions and which don't

- Function should also grab how many questions each concept has:

### Algorithm overhaul

- some ideas at 15:14 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eauQac_23R0
- categorize questions by concept and have a relational graph of concepts, as simpler questions get a longer revision streak, the AI can "merge" questions to create more complicated questions. Explained in the video. This seems like a decent idea, and one that could be automated with AI.

## Feature Creep
