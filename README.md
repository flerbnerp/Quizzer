# Quizzer

Student Question and Answer program that tests students on a variety of questions in a randomized fashion

This is the inspiration for the entire project. Its components serve as the the base for a portion of the backend and all of the frontend-cli.

## Scientific Basis

Quizzer is not just an application that feeds questions, the premise behind conclusion is that by using established memory science, an algorithm can be built that maximizes the learning process

The selection algorithm for Quizzer is based on Hermann Ebbignhaus's study from 1880 to 1885, this study was repeated in 2015 with similar results. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4492928/). The order of which questions are presented is also designed to take advantage of our current understanding of the human mind, the engram, the encoding process, and the retrieval process, with added caution involved to prevent the misinformation effect from setting the user back in their studies.
